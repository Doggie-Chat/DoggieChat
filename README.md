# üê∂ Doggie Chat

## üí° Purpose

The purpose of the Doggie Chat web application is to provide a platform for users to interact and chat with AI puppies. Dogs are known to be loyal friends of humans, but it can be challenging to understand their words in the real world. With Doggie Chat, users can engage in conversations and interact with six different AI dogs, each with their own unique personalities.

### Design and Use

The web application is designed with the following components:

#### Opening View

The opening view consists of three main parts:

1. Register: Users need to register an account by providing necessary information, including an email address for verification purposes.
2. Login: Registered users can log in to access the Doggie Chat webpage.
3. Reset: In case users forget their password, they can reset it through the reset password page. Users need to provide their email address for verification purpose

#### Chat View

The chat view is the main section where users can engage in conversations with the AI dogs. This section is divided into three parts:

1. Dog Selection: Upon logging in, users can choose from three different dogs to chat with. Each dog has its own distinct personality and characteristics.
2. Chat Interface: Once a dog is selected, users can start conversing with the chosen dog. They can exchange messages and have interactive conversations.
3. Check-in and Mini-games: The chat page also includes a check-in feature. Users can check in once a day, earning one point for each check-in. Additionally, a number guessing mini-game is presented after check-in. Successfully completing the mini-game grants the user an extra point. The mini-game disappears once completed, ensuring users can earn a maximum of two points per day. After checking in for 15 minutes or more, the user unlocks the ability to chat with the other three dogs.

### Running the Unit Tests:

To run the unit tests for the Doggie Chat web application, follow these steps:

1. Enter the environment with the required packages. Make sure you have all the necessary dependencies installed.

2. Run the `flasktest.py` script while being in the environment. Make sure you are in the correct directory and haven't made any changes to the file locations.

Note: The unit tests should succeed during the first run. However, when running the tests again after the initial success, failures may occur in the register test because the new account has already been created in the database during the first run of the test script. If you still want to run the test script multiple times, ensure that you remove the record of the `username test4` from both the `checkin` and `user` tables in the database.

Running the unit tests helps ensure that different parts of the Doggie Chat web application function correctly and as intended. It validates the behavior of the login system, chat functionality, and chat history, providing confidence in the application's overall reliability.

### User tests
User tests simulate users' activities to ensure that the Doggie Chat web application functions correctly. The tests cover all three views: opening, chat, and search. Follow the instructions below to run the user tests:

1. **Ensure Flask Server is Running**:
   - Before running the user tests, make sure that one terminal is running the Flask server. If not, start the server by navigating to the `flask` folder of the Doggie Chat application and executing the following command:
     ```bash
     flask run
     ```

2. **Navigate to the `flask` Folder**:
   - Open a new terminal or command prompt and navigate to the `flask` folder of the Doggie Chat repository. Use the following command:
     ```bash
     cd flask
     ```

3. **Run the User Tests**:
   - Execute the following command to run the user tests:
     ```bash
     python -m tests.usertest
     ```

Running the above command will execute the user tests and verify the functionality of the web application. Note that if you want to run the user tests again within the same day, you need to modify the data for the `testuser` in the database. Specifically, you should follow these steps:

1. Access the database used by the Doggie Chat web application.
2. Locate the `checkin` table within the database.
3. Find the row corresponding to the `testuser` account.
4. Update the `last_login` and `current_login` values for the `testuser` to the previous day's date.
   - This step ensures that the functions related to the test mini-game work correctly during subsequent test runs.
5. Save the changes to the database.
